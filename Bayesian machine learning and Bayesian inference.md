Bayesian machine learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses Bayesian probability to make predictions based on data.

Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference that uses Bayesian probability to update an initial probability estimate, or prior probability, as new data becomes available. The process of updating the probability estimate as new data becomes available is called Bayesian inference.

Here's an example to help illustrate Bayesian machine learning and Bayesian inference:

Imagine you are building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood that a customer will purchase a product based on their age and income. You have a large dataset of customer data that includes the ages and incomes of customers, as well as whether or not they made a purchase.

In Bayesian machine learning, you would use this data to build a Bayesian model that estimates the probability of a customer making a purchase based on their age and income. This probability estimate is called the posterior probability.

To build the model, you would first need to specify the prior probability, which is your initial probability estimate before you see the data. The prior probability represents your prior knowledge or belief about the probability of a customer making a purchase based on their age and income.

Next, you would use Bayesian inference to update the prior probability as new data becomes available. For each customer in the dataset, you would use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability of a customer making a purchase given their age and income.

The posterior probability would be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Posterior probability} = \dfrac{(\text{likelihood of the data given the hypothesis}) * (\text{prior probability})}{(\text{normalizing constant})}
$$

The likelihood of the data given the hypothesis is the probability of the data (whether or not the customer made a purchase) given the hypothesis (that the customer will make a purchase based on their age and income).

The prior probability is your initial probability estimate. The normalizing constant is a value that is used to scale the posterior probability so that it adds up to 1.

By updating the prior probability as new data becomes available, you can build a Bayesian machine learning model that makes more accurate predictions about the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on their age and income.Posterior probability =
