# can there be a situation where two simultaneous requests were able to acquire the same redis lock?

It is possible for two simultaneous requests to acquire the same Redis lock if the lock implementation does not use Redis' atomic operations correctly. Redis provides various atomic operations like SETNX (SET if Not eXists) and Lua scripts that can be used to implement a locking mechanism, but if the lock implementation does not use these operations in a thread-safe manner, it is possible for two requests to acquire the same lock simultaneously. Additionally, network delays, high latency, and Redis server overload can also lead to such situations. It's important to carefully design and test the lock implementation to ensure that it provides the desired level of concurrency control.

### Here's an example of a Redis lock implementation that could potentially result in two simultaneous requests acquiring the same lock:

```python

import redis

def acquire_lock(conn, lock_name, acquire_timeout=10):
    lock_value = str(uuid.uuid4())
    lock_acquired = conn.setnx(lock_name, lock_value)
    if lock_acquired:
        conn.expire(lock_name, acquire_timeout)
        return lock_value
    return None

def release_lock(conn, lock_name, lock_value):
    script = """
    if redis.call("get", KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
        return redis.call("del", KEYS[1])
    else
        return 0
    end
    """
    return conn.eval(script, 1, lock_name, lock_value)

# usage example
conn = redis.Redis()
lock_name = "lock_name"
lock_value = acquire_lock(conn, lock_name)
if lock_value:
    # critical section
    # ...
    release_lock(conn, lock_name, lock_value)

```

This implementation uses Redis' SETNX operation to attempt to acquire the lock and its EXPIRE operation to set the lock's timeout. However, it doesn't guarantee that only one request will hold the lock at a time, because the SETNX operation can be executed simultaneously by multiple requests. To avoid this situation, a more robust implementation could use a Redis Lua script to both attempt to acquire the lock and set its timeout atomically.

### Here's an example of a robust Redis lock implementation that uses a Lua script to guarantee that only one request can hold the lock at a time:

```python

import redis

def acquire_lock(conn, lock_name, acquire_timeout=10):
    script = """
    if redis.call("setnx", KEYS[1], ARGV[1]) == 1 then
        redis.call("expire", KEYS[1], ARGV[2])
        return 1
    else
        return 0
    end
    """
    lock_value = str(uuid.uuid4())
    result = conn.eval(script, 1, lock_name, lock_value, acquire_timeout)
    return lock_value if result else None

def release_lock(conn, lock_name, lock_value):
    script = """
    if redis.call("get", KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
        return redis.call("del", KEYS[1])
    else
        return 0
    end
    """
    return conn.eval(script, 1, lock_name, lock_value)

# usage example
conn = redis.Redis()
lock_name = "lock_name"
lock_value = acquire_lock(conn, lock_name)
if lock_value:
    # critical section
    # ...
    release_lock(conn, lock_name, lock_value)

```

This implementation uses a Lua script to both attempt to acquire the lock and set its timeout in a single atomic operation. This ensures that only one request can hold the lock at a time, even in the presence of concurrent requests. The release_lock function also uses a Lua script to guarantee that only the request holding the lock can release it, ensuring that the lock is held for the desired duration.
